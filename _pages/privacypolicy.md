# Privacy Policy

## In short: We've got your back

Our goal is to help you drinking enough water during your day - *not to track you*! We want the least information possible from you, unless you contact us yourself. 

Thirstic does not send any health or activity data to remote servers. All health-related data processing is performed and stored on your device. We're also not tracking individual users with third-party analytics services. If you enable weather forecasts in the app settings, we need to send your approximate location to our weather data provider [Dark Sky (privacy policy)](https://darksky.net/privacy). Anonymized data about your in-app purchases is send to our purchase validation service [Revenue Cat (privacy policy)](https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy).

## Full version

This policy applies to all information collected or submitted on Thirstic's website ([thirstic.app](https://thirstic.app), [thirstic.app](https://thirstic.com)) and our apps for iPhone and any other devices and platforms.

### Information we collect

Thirstic does not collect any health, activity or other sensitive data. All health-related data processing is performed and stored on the user's device.

If the user decides to enable weather forecasts in the app settings, we need to send the users's approximate location to our weather data provider [Dark Sky (privacy policy)](https://darksky.net/privacy) in order to download daily weather forecasts.

The mentioned information may be processed, stored, and used outside of the country in which the user is located.

### Analytics

### Information usage

We use the anonymized information we collect to operate our apps and customer support. We do not share any information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to accomplish Thirstic's functionality (see weather data usage and purchase validation above).

We may disclose your information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal requirements; to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud or abuse, violations of our policies; or to protect our rights and property.
