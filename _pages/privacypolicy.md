Your daily water intake goal is estimated and securely stored on your device. No health or activity data leaves your device. Your water intake is securely encrypted & stored in your Health app. In order to estimate your water intake goal, Thirstic needs to read your activity data. Please allow all requested categories, otherwise the results will be less accurate. No health data leaves your device.

No health data leaves your device, everything (all the logic and calculations) happens on your device. No analytics or tracking included. Exceptions: I need to send your approximate location to darksky.net to download weather reports (if enabled) and Iâ€™ve integrated the revenuecat.com SDK to handle in-app subscriptions. No other third party SDKs are included.
